# 📈 Stock Price Prediction

This project predicts the next-day closing stock prices for Indian companies listed on the **NSE (National Stock Exchange)** using machine learning models. The approach combines historical stock data with technical indicators and trains both **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor** models to forecast prices accurately.

## 📊 Features

- ✅ Predicts **next-day closing prices** using past stock data
- 📉 Implements two models: **Linear Regression** & **Random Forest**
- 📈 Uses technical indicators:
  - 10-day & 50-day Moving Averages
  - Daily Percentage Return
  - Volume Change Percentage
- 📌 Visualizes:
  - Actual vs. Predicted prices
  - Correlation heatmap for feature selection
